When encountering linting errors in any file within this project:

1. Use `npx eslint --fix <filepath>` as the first approach to fix linting errors
2. Only attempt manual fixes if ESLint auto-fix doesn't resolve all issues
3. Apply this rule to all files showing linting errors, regardless of file type or location within the project

Example usage:
```bash
npx eslint --fix src/utils/example.ts
```

This ensures:
- Consistent code style across the codebase
- Efficient handling of formatting issues
- Adherence to project's ESLint rules
