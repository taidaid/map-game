# Map Game - Product Overview

## üéØ Product Vision

**Map Game** is a web-based geographic puzzle game that challenges players to navigate familiar locations using only visual landmarks and spatial reasoning. The core experience centers around the **Blind Navigator** game mode, where players must describe optimal routes between two points without seeing street names, then compare their mental navigation against Google's suggested route.

## üéÆ Core Game Concept

### **Blind Navigator**
> *"Given only a starting point and destination, describe the most efficient route using text instructions without seeing street names, then reveal to compare with Google's suggested route."*

**Challenge**: Test local knowledge and spatial reasoning skills by navigating purely through visual landmarks and intuitive direction-finding.
